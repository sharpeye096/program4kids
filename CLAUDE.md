# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**program4kids** - Programming tutorial for children using Markdown format. The project will use AI-generated content to document AIGC usage experiences.

## Current Structure

- `README.md` - Project description (Chinese)
- Markdown-based tutorials planned
- AI-generated content workflow

## Development Setup

Since this is a Markdown-based tutorial project, typical development commands are not yet established. The project may evolve to include:
- Markdown linting
- Content generation scripts
- Documentation build processes

## Language & Tools

- Primary: Markdown (.md files)
- Potential: Python/JavaScript for content generation scripts
- Chinese language content for tutorials

## Future Considerations

As the project grows, watch for:
- Package.json or requirements.txt for dependencies
- Build scripts for documentation generation
- Linting configurations for Markdown
- AI content generation workflows
